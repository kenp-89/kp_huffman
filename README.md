kp_huffman
==========

Library and software to build a Huffman tree.

Usage: huff <input file>

This is merely a quick and dirty implementation of Huffman tree
generation, still in an early stage. At this point, it only
outputs created structure nodes to the terminal, but this is
only temporary.

Much more to come soon!
